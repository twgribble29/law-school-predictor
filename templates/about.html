    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>The law school admissions process is notoriously opaque. Applicants spend months agonizing over where to apply, often relying on anecdotal advice from forums or expensive admissions consultants. Meanwhile, a wealth of self-reported admissions data exists on platforms like LSD.Law&mdash;but it's difficult for most people to interpret.</p>
    <p>I built this predictor to make that data actionable. By training machine learning models on over 100,000 historical application outcomes, this tool gives applicants a clear, statistical picture of their chances at any ABA-accredited law school.</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>This isn't a simple "median LSAT/GPA" lookup. The model accounts for temporal trends (acceptance rates have dropped 15&ndash;23 percentage points post-2020), interaction effects between your stats and school competitiveness, application timing, and&mdash;when available&mdash;your outcomes at other schools.</p>
    <p>Every design decision was driven by rigorous analysis: we validated against held-out test data, checked calibration across deciles, analyzed errors by school tier and applicant profile, and implemented temporal weighting to ensure predictions reflect the current admissions landscape.</p>

    <h2>Limitations &amp; Ethics</h2>
    <p>I want to be transparent about what this tool can't do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It cannot capture holistic factors (personal statements, recommendations, diversity contributions)</li>
        <li>The training data is self-reported and may contain biases</li>
        <li>URM status is self-reported and imperfect</li>
        <li>Past admissions patterns don't guarantee future outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tool is meant to <em>inform</em> your decisions, not make them for you. Use it as one data point among many.</p>
