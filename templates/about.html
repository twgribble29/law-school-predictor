    <div class="about-body">
        <p>Hey there! I'm Ty, and I built this tool because I was frustrated with the existing law school predictors out there. As someone who loves diving into data and political science, I wanted to create something more accurate and transparent.</p>

        <p>I currently work as a Policy Associate and Campaign Director at Environment Texas, where I combine data analysis with real-world advocacy. Before that, I graduated from UT Austin with a degree in Government (and a pretty solid GPA, if I do say so myself). During college, I got to work in some fascinating research labs&mdash;studying everything from disinformation to policy agendas.</p>

        <p>My passion is really at the intersection of political science and data science. I'm particularly interested in how we can use quantitative methods to understand political behavior, democratic institutions, and policy outcomes. I've published research on democratic attitudes and misinformation, and I'm currently applying to Political Science PhD programs.</p>

        <p>When I built this predictor, I wanted to leverage machine learning in a way that actually helps people make informed decisions about law school. The model uses data from over 900,000 applications, and I've worked hard to make the methodology transparent and the results actionable.</p>

        <p>Outside of data and politics, you'll find me hiking, playing tennis, or probably overthinking sports analytics. I also spend way too much time on Clash Royale strategy, but that's a different kind of data problem.</p>

        <p>Feel free to reach out if you have questions about the model, suggestions for improvements, or just want to chat about political science and data!</p>
